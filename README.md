# Cookly

## Description

**Cookly** is a web application that allows users to discover recipes based on ingredients they already have.

Instead of requiring users to browse long lists or enter full recipe names, Cookly enables them to input one or more ingredients (e.g., `"eggs"`, `"spinach"`, etc.) and instantly receive a list of suggested recipes. The app is built with a user-first approachâ€”minimalist, responsive, and quick to use.

Saved recipes are stored locally, and all recipe data is cleaned and stored in a MongoDB database.
