# Recipe Generator's User Interface

## Overview

The User Interface for this app intends to be simplistic and easy to navigate. We've taken into consideration that most of the users are used to a typical look for a web application (task bars, home page, etc) and a familiar design is more logical.

## Home page

The users are first directed into the home page. Starting from the top, a task-bar displays all of the available pages in the app and makes it easier to navigate them. The middle of the page is filled with a big title reading Cookly and examples of recipe cards for the main features. A short description of the app is written at the bottom of the page along with buttons that direct the users to the features of the app.

## Recipes page

The users are again presented with a task-bar on top. On this page, a search bar also allows users to enter the ingredients they have and the main space of the page is filled with the many recipes that correspond to their search. They have the option to "add" these recipes to their 'My Recipes' page.

## My Recipes page

The users are presented with the task-bar. The top of the page reads as "My Recipesrecipes" and a short descriptions on how to save. The rest of the page is a scrollable space that has all of the user's saved recipes.

## About page

The about page is pretty straight forward. A big title reading "About", and the rest of the page consists of paragraphs, bullet points, and useful information about how to navigate different features and future features that we intend to implement for the app.
