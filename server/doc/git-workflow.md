## Git Workflow
# Team Members: Beshir and Taha
# Branching
Typically, we work together side by side and confirm when to branch there. If this is not the case, we typically just call or text to ask for confirmation. 

# Merging
Similiarly to branching, we would just contact the other to confirm the merge.

# Code Review
So far, we have not be doing any formal Code Review via Git Pull Request, just manually code reviewing them together.
