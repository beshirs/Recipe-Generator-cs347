# Beshir and Tahaâ€™s Project Plan

## Description

A recipe generator application that allows users to input the ingredients and get a recipe. They can also find recipes that best fit their specified macros like protein, carbs, etc.

## Learning Goals

- React & NextJS
- API integration
- User input parsing and matching
- Docker
- Deployment

## Feature Goals

- The main feature of the app is to find food recipes based on the ingredients that users input. This feature is in "Search Recipes" tab.

- The other main feature of the app is to filter all the recipes within the dataset based on the specific macros that the user specifies. This feature is in "All Recipes" tab.

### Essential

- User can input available ingredients
- Recipes are fetched based on those ingredients
- Recipe cards display instructions, ingredients, and image

### Nice-to-have

- Save favorite recipes to local place
- Sort/filter feature

### Stretch goals

- Suggest substitutes for missing ingredients
- Dietary filters (vegan, gluten-free, etc.)
