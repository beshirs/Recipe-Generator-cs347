## Code Review

# Project Description

- Our app allows users to enter ingredients they have and get specific recipes from a large finite dataset. This app will also allow users to filter the large dataset of recipes based on macros that the users specify like protein, carbs, etc.

# Project Status

- UI is basic but functional
- Main UI components like recipe card and nav bar are done
- Search works and Recipes display correctly
- Automated Tests pass
- Save/bookmark feature not done yet
- The option to enter mutiple ingredients is not done yet

# How to Run

- Refer to development.md and running.md for the instructions

# Questions

- Is UI design intuitive and simple to navigate?
- What are some ways we could enchance, improve, or repurpose our current features like ingredient search?
- What are some UI design suggestions?

# Future Plans

- Deploy our app in Docker once we have our database set up correctly
- Front-end improvements
- Finish the ingredients search feature
- Add filter options to "All Recipes" feature
